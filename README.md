# Maximum-Clique-Problem

This project contains an end to end implementation of an optimization model. Linear Programming is used to solve an NP-Hard Maximim clique problem. The problem is modelled in python where the graph implementations are using the networkx package. Gurobipy is the optimization framework used.
